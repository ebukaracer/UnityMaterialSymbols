# Material Symbols (Icons) for Unity
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-blue)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

An add-on that simplifies the use of Google's **Material Symbols** (formerly known as Material Icons) in Unity. The goal is to provide a lightweight, uniform set of icons to ensure consistent design throughout the applicationâ€™s user interface, ultimately enhancing the user experience.

Recommended Unity version: 2022 or higher\
Supported Unity version: 2017 or higher

## Changes

Initial Forked Version -  `v226.0.0`

Based on the original project by [Convalise](https://github.com/convalise)\
URL: https://github.com/convalise/unity-material-symbols

This forked version introduces significant [updates](https://github.com/ebukaracer/UnityMaterialSymbols/blob/main/NOTICE.md#changes-made-in-the-feature-branch) organized into this: [branch](https://github.com/ebukaracer/UnityMaterialSymbols/tree/feature)

## Installation
_Inside the Unity Editor using the Package Manager:_
- Click the **(+)** button in the Package Manager and select **"Add package from Git URL"** (requires Unity 2019.4 or later).
-  Paste the Git URL of this package into the input box: https://github.com/ebukaracer/UnityMaterialSymbols.git#feature
-  Click **Add** to install the package.
-  If your project uses **Assembly Definitions**, make sure to add a reference to this package under **Assembly Definition References**. 
    - For more help, see [this guide](https://ebukaracer.github.io/ebukaracer/md/SETUPGUIDE.html).

## Setup
- Simply add the `MaterialSymbol` component to your UI GameObject, and you are good to go.
- Alternatively, a new object can be added to the scene by right-clicking on the hierarchy window and selecting `UI > Google > New Material Symbol`.
- The inspector provides a window to easily select between the available symbols or icons.

## Quick Usage
The `MaterialSymbol` class inherits from `UnityEngine.UI.Text`, so it has all properties and methods available [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/script-Text.html) such as `color` and `raycast target`.

Each icon is made up of two values: a [unicode-escaped char](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/char#literals) for the symbol itself, and a boolean to indicate whether it's filled or outlined.

The icon can be set programmatically by assigning a new `MaterialSymbolData` object to the `symbol` field:
```cs
public class Demo : MonoBehaviour  
{  
	private MaterialSymbol _materialSymbol;
	
	private void Start()  
	{  
		_materialSymbol.Symbol = new MaterialSymbolData('\uEF55', false);  
	}
}
```

It can also be set directly by assigning the `code` and `fill` properties:
```cs
_materialSymbol.Code = '\uEF55';  
_materialSymbol.Fill = false;
```

Additionally, a serialized `MaterialSymbolData` field can be used to expose the icon inspector in any class:
```cs
public class Demo : MonoBehaviour  
{  
	private MaterialSymbol _materialSymbol;
	
	[SerializeField]
	private MaterialSymbolData symbolData;
	
	private void Start()  
	{  
		_materialSymbol.Symbol = symbolData;  
		_materialSymbol.color = Color.blue;
	}
}
```

## Extras
Locate the `Config Asset` under `Packages > MaterialSymbols > Resources > MaterialSymbolConfig` to edit certain fields, such as the location to store the generated symbol images and so on. Assuming the fields are greyed out(non-editable), then enable `Debug` mode while the asset is focused in the inspector, then switch back to `Normal` mode. The non-editable fields will become editable afterwards.

To remove this package, navigate to: `Racer > Google > Remove Package`

This project was created originally by Conrado (https://github.com/convalise) as an improvement of the deprecated [Unity Material Icons](https://github.com/convalise/unity-material-icons).

It makes usage of the [Material Design icons by Google (Material Symbols)](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).
